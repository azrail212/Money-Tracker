Project Title: 	Money Tracker Mobile Application

Project Team: 		Azra Bećirović & Minela Mustafi

Course Professor: 	Assist. Prof. Dr. Zerina Mašetić


Project Description:

The goal of this project is to build a money tracking application for personal mobile devices. The application can be used to track one’s personal finances, encompassing both income and expenses. 
The user will be able to record the type of each money entry into the application, eg. ‘10$, income, lawn mowing’ or ‘15$, expense, groceries’. 

They can add or edit types of monetary transactions, organizing them into categories, so that the application better suits their lifestyle. For example, “Savings”, “Work-related expenses”, “Child Daycare” are some of the possible user-added categories. 

The application will at all times show the user their current balance, calculated based on their income and expenses. Each category’s balance will also be individually calculated and shown per request.

A functionality where the user can choose to see their past week’s, month’s, or year’s financial statistics will be implemented. This should be very user-friendly, since it will use graphics and pie charts.

The application should enable login from the user so that their previously recorded data can be easily accessed and/or transferred from their current or onto a new device.
